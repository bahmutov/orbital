# Boat by Canal
Boat is a one-stop shop for making awesome Node.js/Express APIs in TypeScript. Inspired by [Angular](https://www.github.com/angular/angular), we want to make it easy to make Node.js APIs for anyone.

Boat uses TypeScript, Express, and MongoDB, as these are industry standard. They're a friggin pleasure to use, and Boat makes it even easier to use them.

### Inspiration
I was writing an API for Canal, and I found that I had to write a significant amount of extra code to just get and save data from my database. Then it hit me: there should be a framework for this. So I am making it right now! Any help would be greatly appreciated.
